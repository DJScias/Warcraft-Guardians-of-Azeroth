I'm going to try to explain position.txt and light.txt
These files contain model coordoinates and angles for use in the WoW Model Viewer.
First thing, NEVER ROTATE THE CAMERA! This will make the coordoinates and angles useless. If you did it accidentally, just reload the model by switching to another model and back.

The first three numbers from position.txt are model coordinates that can be used in...
View > Show model control > Position
...X, Y, Z respectively.
The last three numbers are rotation angles, they can be used in the same place, they're rX, rY, rZ respectively.

The first three numbers from light.txt are light sourse coordoinates that can be used in...
View > Show light control > Position XYZ
...X, Y, Z respectively.
DON'T FORGET TO CHECK OFF "Relative"! Otherwise, the light sourse won't work.
The last number from light.txt is a brightness of "Ambience" color. "Ambience" COLOR MUST BE COLORLESS! To set the brightness, click on the color and select the right brightness.

Ok, now the model is in the same position and the light settings are the same. Take a screenshot and cut a portrait out.
